            <p class="onHover">
              At the hospital I worked in the medical records department, where
              I was very detailed to make sure the proper documents were added
              to each patient's chart. We pulled charts when needed.
              Additionally, I was a medical transcriptionist, so every time
              there was a surgical procedure, ER visit, X-ray procedure, or an
              update to a patient's chart, the doctors would speak it into a
              microphone, and I would turn it into an accurately typed document.

            <p class="onHover">
              Nortex was a feedlot that had about 28k head of cattle. I was
              responsible for entering the data for the feed and medicine the
              cattle got each day, sending out reports to various owners and
              assisting with invoicing and communications.

              I was office manager at my church. I was responsible for many
              aspects of the church, literally from the pavement to the pulpit.
              What does that mean? I made sure the building and property were
              set and ready for church services. I made sure the cleaning and
              setup were done. I ran the office, so I took care of all of the
              financial aspects of the church, i.e. receiving contributions,
              payroll, financial statements, etc. I designed publications from
              assisting with our monthly magazine, weekly bulletin, the church
              website, and handouts and slides for events and conferences. Also,
              on occasion, I was asked to preach on Sunday morning during the
              time we were conducting our pastoral search. I loved my job. Every
              day was a new day with new challenges and experiences! I had an
              opportunity to attend a software development course, and that's
              where my tech journey began.

            <p class="onHover">
              This is my current position.The short version is that when I got
              certified in Software development I was ahead of Covid, so I was
              unable to secure a remote position. After trying for over a year,
              I was prompted me to pursue a different avenue, which is when I
              found my way to Hilmar. My manager that hired me knew me from my
              position at the church and fought for me at my panel interview,
              and I accepted the offer. I went in as an operator -the lowest
              level. I asked a lot of questions and learned the how and why of
              the operations of the plant. In just 2 years, I was promoted to a
              lead operator and covered shift when my supervisor was away.
              Recently, they have decided to close down a portion of our plant,
              so we currently have skeleton crews but a lot more responsibility.
              I am supervisor of my crew now. I enjoy my job, but with the
              uncertainty of our plant, I am pursuing options to secure my
              future. I have the blessing of management to pursue new
              opportunities.
