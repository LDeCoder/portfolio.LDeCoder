          <h4>
            My core values guide me and give me purpose. I provide clarity,

            When those around me start feeling overwhelmed and weighed down, I
            bring a "possibilty" point of view that helps them see the light at
            the end of the tunnel. This is where my sense of humor comes into
            play - laughter is the best medicine, right? Sometimes when life
            gets too heavy, we simply need to laugh a little to gain a new
            perspective.
