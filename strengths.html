              Encouraging others comes natural to me. I can see raw potential in

              them to learn, grow and improve.

              When those around me start feeling overwhelmed and weighed down, I
              bring a "possibilty" point of view that helps them see the light
              at the end of the tunnel. This is where my sense of humor comes
              into play - laughter is the best medicine, right? Sometimes when
              life gets too heavy, we simply need to laugh a little to gain a
              new perspective.
